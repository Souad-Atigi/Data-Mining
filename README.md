Gene Sequence Analysis and Classification

Overview

This project involves analyzing gene sequence data to understand nucleotide distributions, identify stop codons, and apply machine learning techniques for gene classification. The objective is to extract features from gene sequences, perform exploratory data analysis, and develop predictive models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.
